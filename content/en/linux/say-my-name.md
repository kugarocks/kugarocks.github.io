## Linux Torvalds

How to pronounce this name is quite curious, searched it, and someone even made a collection, oh my god, haha.

## Definition of Linux

According to Wikipedia, Linux is both a Unix-like kernel and a generic term for an open-source Unix-like operating system based on the Linux kernel.
The Linux kernel was first released by Linus Torvalds on September 17, 1991, and it is usually packaged into a distribution version,
including the kernel and many system software and libraries provided by the GNU project.

## History of Linux

In 1990, Linus Torvalds took a Unix course at the University of Helsinki.
In 1991, he became interested in operating systems,
but the license for the Minix system (Minimal Unix-like operating system) in the textbook could only be used for teaching.
So he wrote his own operating system kernel, which was the first version of the Linux kernel.

Later, Linus Torvalds released the kernel on the Internet for feedback.
And so, an open-source operating system that gathered global wisdom was born,
accompanied by a series of system software and libraries developed by the GNU team.

## Linux Naming

Torvalds initially wanted to name the operating system Freax, which is a combination of free, freak, and x (Unix).
At first, he also considered using the name Linux, but felt it was too arrogant, so he didn't use it.
His colleague Ari Lemmke, one of the FTP administrators at the time,
thought Freax was not good and, without Torvalds' consent, named the project Linux.
Later, Torvalds also agreed to the name Linux.

## Linux Mascot Tux

Torvalds mentioned that he was bitten by a penguin at the Canberra Zoo.
He thought a slightly chubby penguin sitting after eating was very suitable as the mascot for Linux.
The first person to call this penguin Tux was James Hughes, who said it represented (T)orvalds (u)ni(x).
Additionally, Tux is also an abbreviation for Tuxedo (tailcoat), which resembles the appearance of a penguin.
