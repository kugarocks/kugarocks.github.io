## Introduction

By chance, I found that the domain name `minions.wiki` was not registered, so I created a clean and simple Minions Wiki.
However, the Minions inside are not yet complete, and I will continue to improve them when I have time. If you're interested, feel free to submit a PR.

## HUGO

The project uses Hugo and the [hugo-cards](https://github.com/bul-ikana/hugo-cards) theme.
When I was working on it, I found that hugo-cards does not support the Profile Sidebar, and the mobile layout is not ideal, so I modified it myself.
Later, I submitted a [PR](https://github.com/bul-ikana/hugo-cards/pull/28), which has now been merged,
This is also my first PR merged on GitHub.

## Cursor

The translations inside were completed using Cursor, and I must say that the Cantonese translations are quite interesting.

## Despicable Me Wiki

Below is another wiki website about the Minions movies,
However, it does not support Chinese, has ads, and the interface is also ugly.
