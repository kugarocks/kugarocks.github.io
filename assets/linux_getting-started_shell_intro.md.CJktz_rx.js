Shell provides an interface for users to interact with the operating system, which is the outermost layer of the operating system. Additionally, it supports programming, including variables, loops, conditional judgments, etc., which is also what we commonly call Shell scripts. Common Shells in chronological order are as follows:</p><table tabindex="0"><thead><tr><th>Shell</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Sh</strong></td><td>Bourne Shell, the earliest Shell, authored by Stephen Bourne.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Bash</strong></td><td>Bourne Again Shell, the most commonly used Shell in Linux, developed by GNU.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Dash</strong></td><td>Debian Almquist Shell, commonly seen in Ubuntu.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Zsh</strong></td><td>Z Shell, with more powerful features, the default Shell on macOS.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="relationship-with-terminal" tabindex="-1">Relationship with Terminal <a class="header-anchor" href="#relationship-with-terminal" aria-label="Permalink to “Relationship with Terminal”">​</a></h2><p>The terminal we refer to now is generally a terminal emulator, such as GNOME Terminal, iTerm2, etc. The terminal provides an interface where users can interact with Shell. The terminal does not execute any commands; it only receives input and displays output. Shell is a process running in the terminal, responsible for the actual command interpretation and execution work.
